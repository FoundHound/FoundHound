# FoundHound
Find your pet friend.

Group Name: One Man Band

Member: Wilson Acosta

# Summary: 

FoundHound is a web application that helps pets find their forever home and people find their loyal companion. Based on research from the American Association for the Prevention of Animal Cruelty, there were an estimated 6.5 million animals that entered an animal shelter in 2016. Out of those 6.5 million, an estimated 1.5 million animals were euthanized. 

We want to reduce this number by matching people to their pets based on characteristics of the person and characteristics of the breed/animal. Making a perfect match will prevent the pets from being returned to the shelters. 

# Technologies:

This will be a MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) based project with a high focus on React capabilities. We will an API from the RescueGroups.org site to populate our pet listings. They have no limitations on total requests, records per request, or the number of results we can pull from their database. Another option would be PetFinder.com API which has over 300,000 listings. The only downsides would be its limitations on the requests and having identical listings on their own site. 

A database would be created to gather the information of the users, as well as login information. Currently, there is no api that displays the characteristics of dogs, but there is a website called dogtime.com which has all that information. The website would have to be scrapped and put into a database of its own. 

# Additional Opportunities: 

Create a find my pet feature to help owners find their lost pets
Create a Mobile application
Add a Pet Care section for all things “Pet Care”
